       <h2>MY DAILY LIFE</h2> 
       <p> Though my daily life is extremely monotonous, I try hard to adapt myself to it. Why? Because I intend to be a good student. I wish to render service to my country.I get up at six o’clock every day. After I wash my face and brush my teeth, I begin to review my lessons. I go to school at seven o’clock.After school is over, I return home. We usually have supper at seven o’clock.then I begin to do my homework. I want to finish it before I go to bed.</p>

       <h2>A MODEL STUDENT</h2> 
       <p> Do you mind being called a bad student? Of course not. So far as I know, everybody intends to be (benete) a model student.However, to be a model student is by no means an easy thing. First, he must do his best to obtain knowledge. A man without sufficient knowledge will not succeed. Secondly, he must remember to improve his health. Only a strong man can do GREat tasks. Thirdly, he should receive moral education. If his conduct is not good, no one will consider making friends with him. </p>

In the pool， the fishes are swimming freely. The willow trees are bud. In the pavilion， some old people are playing chess. Look， some children are playing games near the lake. The trees turn green and the flowers come out. In the trees， threr‘re some birds. They‘re singing happily.Everything in the park tell us spring is coming. How beautiful! We have a good time!.</p>
